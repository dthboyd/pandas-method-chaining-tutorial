## Method chaining
It is common practice and encouraged in the Pandas documentation to use 'method chaining.' I use method chaining, for example, to read in my data and to group/sample/slice before plotting. The advantages of method chaining include:
- It saves you from having to define a lot of intermediate variables.
- You can clean your data directly after you read it in, combining all your pre-processing steps into a single command.
- You can plot your data directly after grouping/sampling/slicing/etc.
- It looks good. Your code will read like a story; top to bottom, left to right.

Or, in Tom Augspurger's words:

> "My scripts will typically start off with large-ish chain at the start getting things into a manageable state. It's good to have the bulk of your munging done with right away so you can start to do Scienceâ„¢"

Other tips:
- Use pandas build-in methods when possible, like `resample` below. Otherwise, define your own function and use `pipe`.
- As always, prefer vectorized operations over iterative operations (see `correct_flow_rate_fast` below)
- Familiarize yourself with the difference between `.loc`, `.iloc` and pandas assignment in general ([link](http://tomaugspurger.github.io/modern-1.html))
